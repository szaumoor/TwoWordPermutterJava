# TwoWordPermutter

This is a small utility I wrote semi-seriously to generate cool usernames by reading a file containing the words and finding all the possible combinations of two words.

# How to use
Download the **JAR** in the releases section. Open a terminal and type "**java -jar TwoWordPermutter**" followed by either
1. <**source_file**>
2. <**source_file**> <**max_username_length**>

See **words.txt** for an example of a valid input file, and **words_output.txt** to see the result of an execution.

In the first case, the max length will be assumed to be **14**. The output file will be generated in the working directory of the program.

# Requirements
A machine that has at least **Java 17** installed.
